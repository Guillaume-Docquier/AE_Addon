# AE_Addon  
This is a chrome extension for Astroempires that adds functionalities to the game. Modularity will be a key aspect for the addon. By that I mean that the user should always be able to choose which functionalities he wants to use and disable anything else. Below you will find a list of the expected functionalities. These are the ideas I currently have in mind. Please note that they might not all be implemented in the future. You can however find the list of the currently implemented functionalities as well as the version history.  
If you happen to have ideas in mind, feel free to propose them!
