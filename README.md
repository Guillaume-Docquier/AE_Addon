# AE_Addon  
This is a chrome extension for Astroempires that adds functionalities to the game. Modularity will be a key aspect for the addon. By that I mean that the user should always be able to choose which functionalities he wants to use and disable anything else. Below you will find a list of the expected functionalities. These are the ideas I currently have in mind. Please note that they might not all be implemented in the future. You can however find the list of the currently implemented functionalities as well as the version history.  
If you happen to have ideas in mind, feel free to propose them!  

> Astro Empires (AE) is an Internet Browser game opened in May 2006. The game has attracted over 35,000 players since it first opened  >and has recently started play on its sixteenth server, known as Pegasus.  
>The game takes place in one universe spanning dozens of galaxies, thousands of systems and tens of thousands of worlds in which >players can build up their own Astro Empire of the stars.

# Key features  

## Improved UI  
AE's UI is good but is flawed in many places. I decided to correct these flaws where I could or improve the existing design in some places. For example, the fleet overview is very simple and feels a bit too basic. I added already existing styles to make it feel a lot more polished. The result is a better look and a hover effect on the ship rows so that reading those big crunchy numbers becomes easier.

## Notification system  
Have you ever forgot that you sent a fleet and it got destroyed by your ennemies? This dark age is now over with the Fleet Notification Systemâ„¢. Whenever you launch a fleet, you can decide how long before it lands you want to be notified. A notification will pop-up even if you are not on Astroempires! Moreover, if your fleet is schedueled to land in a couple of days, it will work even if you log in/out multiple times!

## Use only what you want!  
Because I believe in freedom and because not everyone might want all of these (awesome) features, you can choose which ones you want to use. Whenever you want, simply checkout the AE_Addon setting at the bottom of the display settings page. There, you can tick whatever feature you'd like to have.
